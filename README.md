# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Fake news is a major issue in the digital world. This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to classify news articles as **real or fake**. It preprocesses text data, converts it into numerical features, and trains a classification model to detect fake news.

## 📂 Dataset Details
The dataset used contains the following columns:
- **id**: Unique identifier for news article
- **title**: The title of the article
- **author**: The article's author
- **text**: The full text of the article
- **label**: 1 for **Fake News**, 0 for **Real News**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`: Data handling
  - `nltk`: Text preprocessing (stopwords, stemming)
  - `re`: Regular expressions for text cleaning
  - `sklearn`: ML model, evaluation, and data processing

## ⚙️ Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fake-News-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Fake-News-Detection
   ```
3. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
4. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
5. Train the model and evaluate results.

## 🏗️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Remove special characters and stopwords
   - Apply stemming (convert words to their root form)
   - Convert text to lowercase
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - TF-IDF Vectorization for numerical representation
3. **Model Training**:
   - Logistic Regression trained on processed text data
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy score for model performance

## 📊 Results
- The model achieved an **accuracy of XX%** on the test dataset.

## 🔥 Future Improvements
- Implement **Deep Learning models** (LSTMs, Transformers) for better accuracy
- Use **Ensemble Learning** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Expand dataset for better generalization
